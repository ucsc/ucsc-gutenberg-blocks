#### Instructions

- Create a file in the `classes/` to hold the PHP/Wordpress code.
    - Actions can be added
    - Blocks can be registered
    - Site and Network settings
- Include the new file in the `index.php` file and instantiate the class
- Create a js file in `src/blocks/` directory
    - This file can import libs and components but is not a component itself
    - Create and export a function where you can register the block.
    - Make sure the name you are registering here matches the name you registered in PHP
- In `src/index.js` import your function and call it so that the block gets registered.
